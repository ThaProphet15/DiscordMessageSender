# DiscordMessageSender


This python program sends a message in discord for any channel in any server.

## How To Use

Replace message here with the message you want to send. You can still use the discord formatting such as **message** to bold your message.

Replace discord token with your discord token. You can look up how to get your discord token on youtube.

Replace CHANNELID with the ID of the channel you want to send your message in. To get this, make sure your discord account is in developer mode, go to the channel you want to send it in, right click, and hit Copy ID.
